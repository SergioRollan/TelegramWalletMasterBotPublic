# TelegramWalletMasterBotPublic

Wallet Master is a small bot that allows users to organize their money according to their purposes to keep good control of finances, monitor expenses, and limit waste. This bot uses a layered architecture and a non-relational database to store and process user information. I initially designed it for personal use, but ended up liking it so much I decided to upload it here.

This is the public repo. It is not the one that has been deployed. That one has been made private, along with all the private keys.

To use the bot, you only have to talk to https://t.me/ManageWallet_Bot in Telegram.
