# WalletMasterBotProd

Wallet Master is a small bot that allows users to organize their money according to their purposes to keep good control of finances, monitor expenses, and limit waste.
This bot uses a layered architecture and a non-relational database to store and process user information.
I initially designed it for personal use, but ended up liking it so much I decided to upload it here.
